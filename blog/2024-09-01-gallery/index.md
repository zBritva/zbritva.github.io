### Charticulator Gallery

The [Charticulator App](https://ilfat-galiev.im/charticulator/) now has a built-in list of charts (gallery) that can be imported with a single click.

There are only few examples in the diagram list so far, but it will be updated soon, and will also support importing templates. If you want to add your own examples, feel free to contact me.

### Chart filter

The list of charts has a filter of charts by name and type (private, charts that are stored in the browser's indexed database, and public, which are downloaded from a CDN).
