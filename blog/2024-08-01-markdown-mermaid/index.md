![Visual editor preview](./editor-preview.png)

There is POC of the visual for rendering Markdown layout and Mermaid diagrams in Power BI reports.

The visual has built in editor powered by [react-md-editor](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-md-editor) with preview feature.

Diagrams rendering powered by [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)

Future work:

* Implement click handlers on nodes
* Power BI Data binding to nodes
