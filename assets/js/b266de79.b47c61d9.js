The visual saves the template in settings immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Importing template](import.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nClick on \\"Back to report\\" to exit from edit mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visual shows the chart built from template if the visual has all data for template, otherwise it requires to provide columns mapping between data columns and template columns. In this case set column mappings and confirm by clicking on \\"Confirm\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n![Mapping Power BI columns to template columns](./mapping.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that visual should show the chart built from template and data assigned from Power BI.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Visual sample](view-example1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo build the chart from scratch, create instance of the visual and assign data, then switch the visual to old Charticulator visual or to the new Charticulator with editor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that click on \\"Edit\\" in visual menu to switch the visual to editor mode, it launches the Charticulator App for plotting new chart. \\r\\n\\r\\nSave the chart and close editor by click on \\"Back to report\\", the editor version of the visual will show preview version of chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo save the chart switch back to the view version of the visual and save a report.

Here I want to tell you about some small but important changes.\\n\\n## Internal refactoring the code of the visual\\n\\nThe first version was developed in a tight timeframe of 2 weeks. Since the idea was only to combine Chart Studio and Plotly.js visualization library, the internal code was very hard to read. The useState provided by the React library was used for state management, [changes passed by Power BI to the `update`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-visuals-concept) function were passed to the React component via [`forwardRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef).\\n\\nIn version 1.7.3, the Redux Toolkit was added for state management, making the code much easier to understand and maintain.\\n\\n## Save button moved to left panel\\n\\nThe \\"Save\\" button has been moved to the left panel next to the \\"Get In Touch\\" button. Initially, after making changes through the visual editor, it was always necessary to go to the text editor to save the changes\\n\\n![PlotlyJS visual save button screenshot on the left panel](./save_button.png)\\n\\n## Button to save current position of camera\\n\\nAdded \\"Save Camera\\" button to copy current camera coordinates to JSON schema.\\n\\n![The \\"Save camera\\" button on the visual](./save_camera.png)\\n\\nThis makes it faster and easier to set coordinates for the camera, and the camera does not return to the default position during the next visualization.\\n\\n## License error notification banner added\\n\\nAdded a descriptive notification banner with a link to a paid visualization feature.\\n\\nYou can remove the banner by turning off the paid functionality in the viewer\'s settings (Settings => Plotly.js properties => Power BI tooltips) or by [purchasing a subscription](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/checkout/akvelon.plotlyjsvisualbyakvelon?tab=Overview) on Microsoft Office 365 page.\\n\\n![License error notification banner](./license_error.png)\\n\\nYou buy Power BI\'s tooltip functionality, while the visualization itself is free.\\n\\nYou must purchase a license for each report user, regardless of role (report author or consumer).\\n\\nThere are only 2 subscription options at the moment:\\n\\n* Annual plan\\n* Monthly plan\\n\\nThe paid feature is available to everyone in the following environments:\\n\\n* Embedded - Publish To Web, PaaS embed\\n* National/Regional clouds (Depends on general support for transactability in national/regional clouds)\\n* RS Server\\n* Exporting (PDF\\\\PPT) using REST API \\n\\nIf you still have questions, [please contact Akvelon Inc. support](https://akvelon.com/contact-us/?category=Power+BI+Custom+Visuals&product=PlotlyJS+visual+(PBI+certified)).\\n\\n## Add loading segments by 30k rows instead loading all data per update\\n\\nVisuals supports visualization of one thousand data points by default. But this can be changed by the developer in the settings to load thirty thousand data points.\\n\\nBut if even that isn\'t enough, Power BI provides a [Fetch more data API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/fetch-more-data) for visuals that allows you to download more data (but no more than 100MB).\\n\\nPower BI can provide data:\\n\\n* All at once, each time increasing the data portion by thirty thousand (30k, 60k, 90k e.t.c.).\\n* By segments, shifting window of 30k data points\\n\\nThe first approach was already supported by this visual, starting with this version the second option is also supported\\n\\nTo use the new features, set the following settings:\\n\\n![Aggregaate segmetns settings](./aggregate_segments.png)\\n\\nAnd add buttons to shift the segments into `layout` settings of JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"layout\\": {\\n    \\"updatemenus\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\"buttons\\": [\\n          {\\n            \\"args\\": [\\n              {\\n                \\"aggregateSegments\\": false\\n              }\\n            ],\\n            \\"label\\": \\"Previous\\",\\n            \\"method\\": \\"loadPrevSegment\\",\\n            \\"name\\": \\"loadPrevSegment\\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \\"args\\": [\\n              {\\n                \\"aggregateSegments\\": false\\n              }\\n            ],\\n            \\"label\\": \\"Next\\",\\n            \\"method\\": \\"loadNextSegment\\",\\n            \\"name\\": \\"loadNextSegment\\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \\"type\\": \\"buttons\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExample of a chart with buttons to shift segments:\\n\\n![Rendering 30k data points segments by segments](./data-pagination.gif)\\n\\nI hope these changes find applications in providing reports in Power BI for you and your clients."},{"id":"charticulator-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/charticulator-deployment","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-14-charticulator/index.md","title":"Charticulator app deployment","description":"Since the version of Charticulator from Microsoft is retiring, I decided to deploy to GitHub Pages the latest version with fixes and some new functionality.

The second includes only engine to render charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nReport authors will have to use one visual to edit the chart and switch to the second visual before saving the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach allows:\\r\\n\\r\\n* significantly decrease the package size.\\r\\n* easier to obtain certification for the second, because less code for review.\\r\\n* Keeping the first (editorial) version uncertified opens your hands for more technical possibilities, (downloading from the gallery or moving part of the editor code to CDN and so on).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Community\\r\\n\\r\\nFell free to open any [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/zBritva/charticulator-visual-community/discussions), even it is about closing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road map is stabilization and close workflow of the visual.
