# World Greenhouse Gas Emissions

![World Greenhouse Gas Emissions](/images/gallery/world_greenhouse_gas_emissions.png)

A [Parallel Sets](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/parallel_sets.html) displaying the percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from different sectors and end-user areas.
In the first column, the sources are characterized either as "Energy" or as "Non-energy." The second column indicates the industrial sector, the third column indicates end-user areas, and the last column indicates the final emissions in the form of different types of greenhouse gas. To facilitate comparison, the emission values are all converted to CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.

Based on a [chart](https://www.wri.org/resources/charts-graphs/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2005) produced by the [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/).
