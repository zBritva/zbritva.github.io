![Bookshelf chart](/images/gallery/best_bookshelf.png)

This chart shows the best books selected by *The New York Times* between 2013 and 2017.
The width of each book represents its page count, its height represents its Goodreads rating, the height of its inner darker region represents the age of its author at the time of its publication (a height of zero means this is unknown), and its color indicates whether it is Fiction or Nonfiction. Bestsellers are marked with stars.

The original chart was designed by [Tanyoung Kim](https://github.com/tanykim).
Our version features a simpler glyph design and a different layout.
